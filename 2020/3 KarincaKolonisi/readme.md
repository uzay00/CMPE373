|      Ant Colony Optimisation from Scratch         | 03.03.2020       | 23:59           | Upto 5 students          |


Dear students,

For your first homework, you will implement Ant Colony Optimisation from scratch for the problem of finding shortest path in an environment represented as a distance matrix. 
 - You __must write__ a seperate `Ant Class` and `AntColony Class`. 
   - REMARK: _This is an obligation!_
 - I suggest you to start with [this version](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/uzay00/CMPE373/blob/master/2020/3%20KarincaKolonisi/KarıncaKolonisi%20v0.ipynb) of code and improve it. (Add pheromone update method to `Ant Class`, consider a tabu list of visited cities, pheromone decay, write `AntColony Class` from scratch etc)
 
You should follow my [ant colony notes](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/uzay00/CMPE373/blob/master/2020/3%20KarincaKolonisi/ant_uzay.pdf) to fullfill the requirements of the code.

## Output
Write a report which includes:
 - Describe how Ant Colony Optimisation works
 - Describe your code for the `Ant Class`
 - Describe your code for the `AntColony Class`
 - Describe your code for the Environment
 
Bring your printed report on the given due date. (Please, dont forget to write the student number, name&surname of all your team mates to the report.)
